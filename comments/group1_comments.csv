Teams on the list have preference weight.   4. On each preference level, do lottery(create a random number) algorithm.  5. deal with teams and users didn't match in the lottery.    eg:    9 users  3 teams each have 3 positions(front-end, back-end, non-requirement)  only users fit the skill can apply for a position.  after filling a list:  user1: team1(first choice) team2(second choice) team3(last choice)  user2: team1(first choice) team3(second choice)  user3: team1(first choice) team3(second choice)  user4: team2(first choice) team3(second choice)    1st lottery:   run the first choice, in this round, user4 get the position in team2 because no other competitor. user1 get the position in a lottery.  2nd lottery:  run the second choice. user1 and user4 have already won in first round, they will be out of consideration. User2 and user3 run the lottery. User3 win.  result: team1(user1),team2(user4), team3(user3)  3nd lottery:  run the last choice. Everyone have the last choice find a position. The run finishes.    There is possibility that some users don't get any of the positions in their list (user2 in the eg). In this case, users can apply for other free positions.    Explanation on Lottery algorithm:   Chances are presented as a line segment, for example, [0-10].  For users compete for a position, divide the line into several same segments.(10 people, 10 segments, each one owns 1. user1[0-1),user2[1-2),user3[2-3)......).  Generate a random number between 0-10, see on which segment the number is. The user owns the segment win the lottery.     If anyone has better ideas?","278210099"
