83	45	user2	1487440623	1487440840	Good news @DevArenaCN @KaustubhG The verification api call is implemented and tested to be working. We are able to record audio and send using FileInputStream. I am getting expected results.	280862988
92	46	user2	1487447622	1487447622	"So what happens is -> user receives email confirmation. User clicks on email, then on the backend you would confirm the email, then make an api call to Microsoft, receive the profile id and store it with the respective user. Then when that user does login, you retrieve from the database, and return it with the login api call response (as an extra parameter). I receive the profile id and store it in the app."	280870440
93	46	user2	1487447735	1487447735	This does sounds a little complicated :sweat_smile: and maybe unnecessary. But the point is to separate the new profile creation for voice api from the app so that we don't run out of profiles. 	280870542

For the server side, integrating microsoft api call for profile creation at account creation. This will make the voice login process very convenient for the end user.     Apart from these I don't think we need more. We could implement timing in the app, that would depend on how easy it is, and what kind of statistics we record."	288189066
